    "Income Statement": [
        "**Revenue** for FY2024 was $2,958.4M, flat versus the $2,956.4M of FY2023 and down 0.5% from FY2022. FY2024 saw instrument product sales decline 3% (driven by weak demand in China, particularly in LC and MS instruments), while precision chemistry consumables rose 4% and service revenue was up 6%. Ex-China, sales grew 2%. For the LTM period ended Q2 2025 (LTM: July 2024 \u2013 June 2025), rolling twelve-month revenue was $3,090M, up ~4% over FY2024 (Q2 2024 LTM: $2,976M), driven by a rebound in instrument sales and strong growth in recurring chemistry and service revenues. **Q2 2025 revenue was $1,433.0M YTD, up 7% YoY** for the comparable period.",
        "Throughout FY2024, sharp declines in China (10% in 2024, 22% in 2023) offset steady growth elsewhere. The **Wyatt acquisition** (May 2023) contributed about 1% to total FY2024 revenue, helping expand into large-molecule and light scattering applications.",
        "The **drivers of revenue** into FY2025 LTM were: (1) Rebounding demand in Asia ex-China and Europe; (2) Double-digit expansion in chemistry consumables due to customer pull-forward ahead of US-China tariffs ($8M chemistry sales presumably pulled into Q2 2025 in China); (3) Ongoing services growth across installed base; (4) Lapping severe China declines in the prior year; (5) Modest contribution from M&A (Halo Labs acquisition in Q2 2025 for specialized imaging and aggregate detection tools).",
        "The **EBITDA margin** (approximated as operating margin) for FY2024 was 27.9%, up slightly from 27.7% in FY2023 and down from 29.4% in FY2022. Drivers for FY2024 included cost savings from workforce reductions, strong chemistry/service mix, and the absence of 2023\u2019s severance costs. Offsets included higher annual incentive compensation, full-year Wyatt amortization, and increased wage/SG&A inflation. Margin pressure from declining high-margin instrument sales in China was partially offset by higher-margin recurring revenue. FX was a ~140bps margin headwind in 2024. For the LTM through Q2 2025, margins are tracking modestly higher due to stronger volumes, improved sales mix (recurring/chemistry), and lower incentive costs, partially offset by transaction costs (~$14M related to the pending BD Biosciences & Diagnostics acquisition), higher ERP/IT investments, and some recovery in instrument mix.",
        "Summary table: FY2024 Revenue $2,958.4M; Operating Income $826.4M (27.9% margin). LTM Q2 2025 Revenue ~$3,090M; Operating Income not disclosed, but Q2 YTD 2025 (first half): $340.0M on revenue of $1,433M (23.7% margin; Q2 24 = 26.7%, Q2 25 = 24.4%, reflecting increased costs/transaction expenses)."

    "Balance Sheet": [
        "As of Q2 2025 (June 28, 2025), **total debt was $1,457M**, consisting of $260M current and $1,197M long-term debt. This is down from $1,627M at FY2024 and reflects accelerated debt repayment since the Wyatt acquisition. The **leverage ratio (Total Debt + Capitalized Operating Leases / EBITDAR)** at Q2 2025 is estimated at 1.6x\u20132.1x, assuming EBITDAR LTM ~$750\u2013$900M (exact EBITDAR/LTM rent not disclosed; operating lease liabilities at $81M). This is an improvement from 2.2x\u20132.6x at the time of Wyatt closing. At FY2023, leverage was temporarily elevated (~2.8x\u20133.0x) due to the Wyatt transaction.",
        "Cash and cash equivalents were **$367M** as of Q2 2025 (up from $325M at FY2024).",
        "Revolver borrowing capacity as of Q2 2025 was $1.6B (total facility $1.8B, amended in May 2025). None drawn except $200M; up to $50M available for letters of credit.",
        "**Liquidity** (cash + undrawn revolver**): $367M + $1,600M = $1,967M at Q2 2025.",
        "**Stockholders\u2019 equity** at Q2 2025 was $2,160M, improved from $1,829M at FY2024 due to retained earnings growth and positive FX other comprehensive income.",
        "**Dividends:** Waters has not declared or paid any cash dividends in FY2022, 2023, 2024, or the LTM period, and continues to have a policy of no common stock dividends.",
        "**Share repurchase:** No open market repurchases in FY2024 or YTD 2025. Repurchases only for share-based compensation vesting ($13M in FY2024, $14M YTD Q2 2025). Board authorization for $1.0B remains through 2028.",

    "Cash Flow Statement": [
        "**FY2024 Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Operating cash flow $762M less capex/software $142M = $620M. FY2023 FCF = $603M \u2013 $161M = $442M. Q2 2025 LTM FCF is estimated at $800M \u2013 $185M = $615M (using 1H\u201925: $301M OCF, $48M capex, on track to $600M+ full-year). FCF conversion remains strong, recovering from 2023\u2019s temporary impact from integration/acquisition costs, higher incentive payments, and working capital swings.",
        "**Q2 2025 YTD**: Operating cash flow $301M, capex/software $48M; FCF $253M for half-year.",
        "**Major M&A:** In FY2023, Waters acquired Wyatt Technology (~$1.3B cash, closed May 2023, full year of consolidation from 2024). The LTM period (Q3 2024\u2013Q2 2025) also includes the acquisition of Halo Labs (closed May 2025) for $35M (net of cash acquired, $24M to goodwill; $13M to intangible assets; $2M in customer relationships, $2M in developed technology; negligible impact on financials). In July 2025, Waters also signed a transformative (pending/unsigned) $17.5B deal to acquire BD\u2019s Biosciences & Diagnostics business (not closed; not reflected in LTM numbers). No other material acquisitions in LTM.",
        "**Dividends:** No dividends paid in FY2022, FY2023, FY2024, or LTM.",
        "Other key cash flow uses: Debt repayments of $900M in FY2024; $240M YTD Q2 LTM; ERP capex and software implementation ($130M projected through 2027; $7M spent YTD Q2 2025).",
        "**Working capital:** Q2-2025 cash flow reflects working capital normalization, with strong customer advances and deferred revenue building to $420M (up from $320M at FY2024); inventory rising to $541M due to tariff-related safety stock and higher sales volume.",
        "**Summary Table:** FY2024: OCF $762M, CapEx/software $142M, FCF $620M. FY2023: OCF $603M, CapEx/software $161M, FCF $442M. LTM Q2 2025 (estimate): OCF $800M, CapEx/software $185M, FCF $615M."
