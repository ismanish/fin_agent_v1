    "Income Statement": [
        "**Revenue in FY2024 was $42,879 million, flat compared to $42,857 million in FY2023 (0% change). LTM revenue through Q2 2025 was $43,557 million** (calculated as FY24 plus Q1\u2013Q2 2025 less Q1\u2013Q2 2024). Organic revenue growth in FY2024 was 0%. In the LTM, organic revenue growth was 1%. Growth drivers in FY2024 included strong momentum in Electron Microscopy (Analytical Instruments), growth in Immunodiagnostics/Transplant Diagnostics (Specialty Diagnostics), and resilience in the Research & Safety Channel and Clinical Research businesses. These were offset by continued normalization in COVID-19-related revenues (from $0.33B in FY23 to $0.10B in FY24) and a decline in Life Sciences Solutions due to reduced demand for COVID-19 testing products and weak macroeconomic conditions, especially in China.",
        "**Segment analysis for FY2024:** Life Sciences Solutions revenues declined 3% ($9,977M \u2192 $9,631M, with acquisition benefit), driven by a fall-off in COVID-19 testing. Analytical Instruments grew 3% ($7,263M \u2192 $7,463M), driven by Electron Microscopy. Specialty Diagnostics grew 2% ($4,405M \u2192 $4,512M), led by ImmunoDiagnostics and Transplant Diagnostics. Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services grew 1% ($23,041M \u2192 $23,157M), as pharma services growth was offset by reduced COVID-19 vaccine demand.",
        "**EBITDA margins**: In FY2024, GAAP operating margin increased to 17.1% from 16.0% in FY2023 (up 1.1 pts). Adjusted operating income margin, representing core EBITDA margin, declined slightly to 22.6% (from 22.9%). In LTM Q2 2025, adjusted operating margin was 21.9%. Margin compression is primarily attributed to an unfavorable business mix (reduced high-margin COVID-19 sales, higher exposure to lower-margin services), inflation, and increased strategic investments (mainly in commercial/commercial infrastructure, R&D, and capacity). Productivity improvement (cost savings from PPI, supply chain, and restructuring) partially offset these headwinds. Notably, the Life Sciences Solutions segment's margin improved in FY24 to 36.4% (+2.1 pts) due to productivity improvements, but this was partially offset by lower demand.",
        "**Net income for FY2024** was $6,338 million (GAAP), up 5.7% from $5,995 million in FY2023, driven by improved margins, lower amortization, and reduced interest expense."

    "Balance Sheet": [
        "Most recent fiscal year-end: December 31, 2024. Most recent LTM date: June 28, 2025.",
        "**Total debt at FY2024 was $31,275 million, including $2,214 million short-term and $29,061 million long-term**. At LTM Q2 2025, total debt increased to $35,229 million (Q2 2025: $2,214M short-term + $33,015M long-term), reflecting new issuances for the Olink acquisition and anticipated Solventum acquisition.",
        "**Capitalized operating leases** (estimated): As of Dec 31, 2024, operating lease liabilities were $1,500 million (ROU asset: $1,489M; liabilities: $1,501M per 10-K Note 13). For simplicity, we use $1.5B for capitalized operating leases. Thus, at FY24, leverage = (Total Debt + Capitalized Leases) / EBITDAR = (31.3B + 1.5B) / (7.3B Op Inc + 1.95B D&A + 0.35B lease expense) = **Leverage ratio \u2248 3.9x**. For LTM Q2 2025, the ratio is (35.2B + 1.5B) / [~7.4B Op Inc (LTM estimate) + ~1.95B D&A + ~0.36B lease expense] \u2248 **Leverage ratio ~4.3x** (Estimate: EBITDAR calculated from last four quarters; D&A and lease expense from 10-K). The leverage profile increased in the LTM due to new debt issuance for the Olink acquisition and pending Solventum acquisition.",
        "**Liquidity**: As of June 28, 2025 (Q2 quarter-end), cash & cash equivalents were $4,576M, with $1,814M in short-term investments (total $6,390M in liquid assets). Revolving credit facility remains undrawn, capacity of $5,000M, less immaterial LOCs outstanding \u2014 total available liquidity exceeds $11.3B.",
        "Shareholders' equity increased to $50,512M at Q2 2025 (vs. $49,584M at FY24). Book value per share increased."

    "Cash Flow Statement": [
        "**Free Cash Flow (FCF) in FY2024 was $7,324 million** (Operating cash flow $8,667M less capex $1,400M plus asset sale proceeds $57M) \u2014 an increase from $7,014M in FY2023, driven by improved working capital management and strong operational cash generation. **In the LTM (Q3'24\u2013Q2'25), FCF was approximately $6,557M** (Operating cash flow trailing four quarters \u2248 $7.7B, with capex about $1.15B over H2'24 and H1'25 per cash flow schedules); the drop from FY24 reflects higher working capital outflows and the upfront costs of the Olink acquisition in H2'24/LTM.",
        "**Acquisitions:**",
        "- In July 2024, TMO closed the $3.1B cash acquisition of Olink Holding AB (high-growth proteomics).",
        "- In FY2023: The Binding Site Group ($2.70B, specialty diagnostics, Jan 2023), CorEvitas LLC ($910M, real-world evidence, Aug 2023), and a small U.S. Raman-spectroscopy business ($31M, 2023).",
        "- Pending: Solventum Purification & Filtration (expected close late 2025, $4B).",
        "**Dividend payout:** FY2024 cash dividends paid were $583M ($1.56/share), up from $523M ($1.40/share) in FY2023 and $455M ($1.20/share) in FY2022. The dividend increased at a CAGR of ~13% over the past three years.",
        "**Share repurchases:** Thermo Fisher repurchased $4.0B of common stock (7.4 million shares) in FY2024; in Q1 2025, repurchased an incremental $2.0B (3.6M shares). Repurchases were consistent with historical capital prioritization after major M&A.",
        "**Operating cash flow in FY2024 was $8,667M, up from $8,406M in FY2023.** Key drivers were working capital stability, despite acquisitions and moderate revenue growth."
