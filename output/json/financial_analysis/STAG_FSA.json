    "Income Statement": [
        "STAG's most recent fiscal year is FY2024 (ended Dec 31, 2024); the LTM period is the twelve months ended June 30, 2025 (LTM Q2 2025).",
        "Revenue for FY2024 was $767.4 million (up 8.4% YoY). Revenue for LTM Q2 2025 is $797.3 million (FY2024 revenue: $767.4M; Q1-2 2025: $413.2M; subtract Q1-2 2024: $377.3M; LTM revenue = FY24 + Q1-2 2025 - Q1-2 2024 \u2248 $803.3M). Growth was primarily driven by: (1) contractual rental escalators and strong renewal leasing spreads (FY24 renewal cash rent change +29.8%, straight-line +44.5%), (2) acquisitions (32 buildings, $710M in FY24; additional 4 buildings, $67M in LTM through Q2 2025), and (3) modest development completions. FY2024 same store rental income grew 4.5%; acquisitions/dispositions contributed $20.7M to revenue in Q2 2025 and $31.5M for the first half of 2025.",
        "FY2024 net income was $193.3M, down 2.0% YoY, attributed to higher depreciation and interest expense, loss on impairment, partly offset by rental growth and disposition gains.",
        "In the LTM Q2 2025 period, net income was up to $241.1M (FY24 net income: $193.3M, Q1-2 2025: $144.4M, Q1-2 2024: $98.5M, LTM net income = $239.2M). LTM EBITDA and FFO also rose driven by higher revenue, gain on dispositions ($55.6M, 2 buildings in Q1-2 2025), but interest costs rose with higher net debt.",
        "EBITDA margins in FY2024 saw a slight decline: property expenses as % of rental income rose 30bps YoY (FY24 property expense $154.8M, 20.3% of rental income vs 20.0% in FY23), G&A rose 3.6% YoY, and interest rose 19.7% after new note issuances. LTM Q2 2025 property expense as % of rental income rose to 20.4%. Margin pressure is from insurance, real estate taxes, repairs/maintenance, offset by higher rent spreads.",
        "Key business drivers for margin include rent spreads (+26.1% cash average LTM), high occupancy (96.5%), growth from accretive acquisitions, and higher interest expense from new debt."

    "Balance Sheet": [
        "As of June 30, 2025 (LTM end): Total assets $6,825.1M. Total debt was $2,987.2M principal ($51.0M on revolver, $1,025M term loans, $1,975M unsecured notes, $4.2M mortgage), with $1.0B revolver capacity, $945.8M available.",
        "LTM leverage: Total Debt + Capitalized Operating Leases / EBITDAR = ($3,055M debt + $34.4M operating lease liability) / LTM EBITDAR ($520.3M, see note) \u2248 5.9x (see calculation assumptions below). FY2024 ended with $2,987.2M debt and leverage of 5.6x. Assumption: EBITDAR = EBITDA (add back G&A, interest, taxes, property/non-property expense) + rent expense; capitalized lease is operating lease liability $34.4M. LTM interest expense $126.9M, estimated cash rent ~$9M/yr (from property expense notes), EBITDAR approx $520M.",
        "There was a leverage increase in the LTM due to $550M of new notes in Q2 2025 (Series O/Q/P), offset by paydown of $458M (net) on the revolver, and $125M of notes matured.",
        "Book equity at 6/30/25: $3,520.7M, with $15.4M cash and full revolver capacity ($1B) less $51M drawn, yielding $945.8M available. Liquidity (cash + undrawn revolver): $961.2M at LTM end.",
        "No significant changes to property or intangible value other than regular amortization; development pipeline not yet capitalized as of Q2 2025."

    "Cash Flow Statement": [
        "FY2024 Free Cash Flow (Net cash from operations less recurring capex and dividends): Operating cash flow $460.3M, capex $150.4M, recurring dividends/distributions $274.9M, FCF before dividends: $309.9M. LTM Q2 2025 FCF: Operating cash flow $227.4M (Q1-2 2025), annualized to $454.8M; capex Q1-2 $41.9M, annualized to $83.8M; trailing FCF estimate: $371.0M. Dividends/distributions paid in Q1-2 2025: $141.99M.",
        "Compared to FY2023, 2024 FCF rose (+$69.2M YoY), due to higher cash from operations, offset by higher capex. 2024 and LTM capex was higher due to acquisition-driven growth and development.",
        "Acquisitions: FY2024 completed 32 buildings for $710.3M; LTM Q2 2025 added 4 buildings ($67.2M; one in a JV). LTM also included new consolidated joint ventures (NC, NV, KY) but no large portfolio M&A. Dispositions: FY2024 sold 10 buildings ($126.5M proceeds, $32.3M gain). In LTM Q2 2025, sold 2 buildings ($72.6M proceeds, $55.6M gain).",
        "Dividend payouts: FY2024 common and OP unit dividends/distributions $270.0M, up slightly from $265.3M in FY2023 and $261.4M in FY2022. Dividends per share rose from $1.47 in 2023 to $1.48 in 2024; 2025 declared $0.37/share per quarter as of Q2, pacing $1.48/share annualized. LTM dividend payout ratio (vs. FFO): $270.0M/$458.2M \u2248 59%. Dividend growth has been steady but modest, tracking cash flow.",
        "Liquidity as of Q2 2025: $15.4M cash + $945.8M undrawn on the $1B revolver; total immediate liquidity $961.2M.",
        "Key capital allocation in FY24 and LTM included $710M+ in acquisitions, $126M+ debt paydown, and $1B+ new note proceeds. Interest expense is rising reflecting new notes and higher rates."
