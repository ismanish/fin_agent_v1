    "Income Statement": [
      "Investment income grew 6% in FY24, driven by strong market performance in the Washington, D.C. metro area due to favorable demand-supply dynamics (54% less construction since 3Q22) and limited availability of value-oriented housing. Same-store lease growth stood at 2.3% in FY24, with strong occupancy of 95%. Market tailwinds were offset by oversupply in the Atlanta housing market (expected to improve by FY26) and delinquency-related occupancy pressure (~2% of revenue in 4Q24 due to higher-than-expected delinquencies). These are being addressed via improved processes and eviction timelines.",
      "In YTD period, Elme continued to see strong investment income growth of ~3%, driven by similar market dynamics. Despite high exposure to Washington, D.C., only 7.2% of jobs are non-DoD federal agency jobs, minimizing DOGE risk.",
      "The Fund generated $118.0M EBITDA in FY24, with margins contracting 130bps due to higher utility and administrative costs. EBITDA margins declined 30bps in LTM period."
