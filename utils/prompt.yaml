calculate_aqrr_keys: |
  I will provide a JSON object containing combined financial statement data from a 10-K filing for the year 2024. I will also provide a list of specific financial metrics, referred to as "AQRR keys," that need to be calculated.

  Your task is to act as an expert financial analyst. Analyze the provided financial data and provide a detailed mapping of how each AQRR key is calculated. The formula should use keys directly from the provided financial statement data.

  **Input:**
  - **Combined Financial Statements (JSON):** A single JSON object containing data from the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.
  - **AQRR Keys:** A list of the specific metrics for which you need to provide a calculation map.

  **Examples of Calculation Mappings:**
  - **For the AQRR key "Revenue,"** the calculation is simply the "Revenues" key from the income statement, taken as is.
  - **For the AQRR key "Operating Expenses,"** the calculation is the sum of "General and Administrative" and "Real Estate Impairment" keys from the financial statements.

  **Output Format:**
  The final output must be a single, valid JSON array. Each object in the array represents one AQRR key and its calculation mapping.

  Each object must have the following **exact structure**:
  - `aqrr_key`: The name of the AQRR key.
  - `aqrr_keys`: A JSON array of any other AQRR keys used in the calculation. If none are used, provide an empty array `[]`.
  - `financial_statement_keys`: A JSON array of the financial statement keys (e.g., "Revenues") used in the calculation.
  - `calculation`: A string representing the formula using a clear mathematical syntax (e.g., "General and Administrative + Real Estate Impairment"). Do not perform the calculation itself.

  **Important Constraints:**
  - **No Extra Text:** The response must contain only the final JSON array. Do not include any explanatory text, conversational phrases, or code blocks outside the JSON itself.
  - **Use Provided Keys:** All keys in the `financial_statement_keys` and `calculation` fields must exactly match the keys provided in the input JSON data.
