    "content": "For the past fiscal year (2024), the 10-K report indicates that revenue growth was primarily driven by strong customer demand for thermal analysis (TA) instruments and services. Sales growth was broad-based across most major geographies, with the exception of some weakness in China. The growth outside of China was attributed to increased demand for TA products and services. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact, decreasing sales growth by 1%.\n\nFor the latest twelve months (LTM) period, the most recent 10-Q filings show continued growth in both product and service sales. For the six months ended June 28, 2025, product sales increased by 8% and service sales by 5% compared to the prior year period. The overall revenue growth in the LTM period has been supported by ongoing demand for both products and services, with product sales showing slightly stronger growth.\n\nIn summary, the key drivers for revenue growth in both the past fiscal year and LTM period have been:\n- Strong customer demand for thermal analysis instruments and services\n- Broad-based growth across major geographies (excluding China)\n- Product sales outpacing service sales in recent quarters\n\nReferences:\n- 2024 10-K report\n- 2025 Q2 10-Q report (six months ended June 28, 2025)"

    "content": "The 2024 10-K report for WAT provides detailed context on the strong customer demand for thermal analysis (TA) instruments and services:\n\n- TA instruments, including thermal analysis, rheometry, and calorimetry systems, are heavily used in material testing laboratories. They provide critical insights into the behavior of materials during processing, packaging, transport, usage, and storage. These instruments are essential for predicting the suitability and stability of industrial polymers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, metals, and viscous liquids in various industrial, consumer goods, and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.\n\n- In 2024, TA introduced several new instrument systems that contributed to increased demand:\n  - The Rheo-IS accessory for Discovery Hybrid Rheometers, enabling simultaneous electrical impedance and rheological measurements, which is particularly valuable for scientists working on new battery formulations.\n  - The Rapid Screening-Differential Scanning Calorimeter (RS-DSC), designed for biopharmaceutical developers, offering high-throughput and precise thermal stability testing for high-concentration biologic formulations, especially antibody drugs and engineered proteins.\n  - The Discovery Core Rheometer, a modern rheometer designed for routine manufacturing quality control and assurance laboratories, capable of handling diverse material types such as battery slurries, printing inks, food, and personal care products.\n\n- Service and support for TA instruments represented more than 25% of TA\u2019s sales in 2024. Service sales are primarily derived from support plans, replacement parts, and billed labor fees for repair, maintenance, and upgrades of installed systems.\n\n- The demand was broad-based across most major geographies, with the exception of some weakness in China. Growth outside China was attributed to increased demand for TA products and services.\n\nIn summary, strong customer demand for TA instruments and services in 2024 was driven by the critical role these systems play in material characterization across multiple industries, the introduction of innovative new products tailored to emerging applications (such as battery and biologic formulation testing), and the ongoing need for service and support of installed systems.\n\nReference: 2024 10-K report."
