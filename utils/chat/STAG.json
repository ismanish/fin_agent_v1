    "content": "To analyze the change in Gross Margin for STAG in the most recent full year (2023, as per the 10-K report), we need to look at revenues and direct costs:\n\n- **2023 Revenues (10-K):** $707,835,000\n- **2023 Direct Costs of Leased and Rented Property:** $139,596,000\n- **Gross Margin (2023):** ($707,835,000 - $139,596,000) / $707,835,000 \u2248 80.3%\n\nComparing to the previous year (2022):\n\n- **2022 Revenues:** $657,345,000\n- **2022 Direct Costs:** $125,701,000\n- **Gross Margin (2022):** ($657,345,000 - $125,701,000) / $657,345,000 \u2248 80.9%\n\n**Key Drivers Behind the Change:**\n- **Revenue Growth:** Revenues increased by $50,490,000 (7.7%) from 2022 to 2023.\n- **Direct Costs Growth:** Direct costs increased by $13,895,000 (11.1%) from 2022 to 2023.\n- **Gross Margin Decline:** Gross margin decreased slightly from 80.9% in 2022 to 80.3% in 2023.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe slight decline in gross margin was primarily driven by direct costs growing at a faster rate (11.1%) than revenues (7.7%). This suggests that cost pressures\u2014such as higher property operating expenses or increased maintenance costs\u2014outpaced the growth in lease income, leading to a modest reduction in gross margin.\n\n**Reference:** 2023 and 2022 10-K reports."
