The primary drivers for this decline were:\n\n- **Dilutive Impact of 2023 Acquisitions:** The acquisitions completed in 2023 negatively impacted segment operating margins, specifically for the EMG segment, by 270 basis points in 2024.\n- **Integration Costs:** EMG\u2019s operating income and margins for 2024 included $29.2 million of integration costs related to the Paragon acquisition, which further reduced segment operating margins by 130 basis points.\n- **Organic Sales Decrease:** Excluding acquisition and integration impacts, EMG\u2019s operating margins still decreased by 120 basis points compared to 2023, primarily due to an organic sales decrease attributed to customer inventory normalization in automation and engineered solutions core businesses.\n\nFor the LTM (last twelve months) period, similar drivers persisted:\n- The negative impact from recent acquisitions continued to dilute margins.\n- Integration costs remained a factor.\n- Organic sales softness, especially in core business areas, contributed to margin pressure.\n\nIn summary, the decline in EBITDA margins for the past fiscal year and LTM period was mainly due to acquisition-related dilution, integration expenses, and lower organic sales volumes. These factors outweighed any operational improvements or cost efficiencies realized during the period.\n\n(Source: 2024 10-K report)"

    "content": "**Drivers Behind Revenue Growth:**\n\n- **Past Fiscal Year (2024):**  \n  According to the 2024 10-K report, AME\u2019s revenue growth was primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions completed in 2023, as well as favorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales growth was limited due to customer inventory normalization, particularly in automation and engineered solutions core businesses.\n\n- **Most Recent Fiscal Quarter (Q2 2025):**  \n  The 2025 Q2 10-Q report states that net sales for the second quarter of 2025 increased by $43.3 million or 2.5% compared to the same quarter in 2024. The main drivers were:\n  - A 2% increase from acquisitions.\n  - A 1% favorable effect of foreign currency translation.\n  - Higher demand in all markets, with international sales up 6.7%, also supported by recent acquisitions.\n\n**Acquisitions Made in the Same Timeline:**\n\n- **2023 Acquisitions (impacting 2024 fiscal year):**  \n  The 2024 10-K report identifies the following acquisitions:\n  - Paragon Medical\n  - Amplifier Research\n  - United Electronic Industries\n  - Bison Gear & Engineering\n\n- **Recent Acquisitions (impacting 2025 fiscal quarter):**  \n  The 2025 Q2 10-Q report highlights:\n  - Virtek Vision International (acquired October 2024)\n  - Kern Microtechnik (acquired January 2025)\n\n**Summary:**  \nRevenue growth in the past fiscal year and quarter was primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions and favorable currency effects, with additional support from increased demand in international markets. The key acquisitions during this period were Paragon Medical, Amplifier Research, United Electronic Industries, Bison Gear & Engineering, Virtek Vision International, and Kern Microtechnik.\n\n(Sources: 2024 10-K report, 2025 Q2 10-Q report)"

Organic sales growth was limited due to customer inventory normalization, especially in core automation and engineered solutions businesses.\n\nQuantitative Data:  \n- Fiscal Year 2024 (from 2024 10-K): Revenue was $6,941.2 million, up 4.5% from $6,596.9 million in 2023.\n- LTM Period (Q3 2024, trailing twelve months): Revenue totaled approximately $8,456.1 million (sum of last four quarters from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024).\n\nQualitative Drivers:  \n- **Acquisitions:** The majority of revenue growth was attributable to the full-year impact of 2023 acquisitions (Paragon Medical, Amplifier Research, United Electronic Industries, Bison Gear & Engineering) and new acquisitions in 2024 (Virtek Vision International, Kern Microtechnik).\n- **Foreign Currency:** Favorable currency translation contributed positively to reported revenue.\n- **Organic Sales:** Organic growth was constrained by customer inventory normalization, particularly in automation and engineered solutions segments, leading to softer demand in these areas.\n\nStrategic Initiatives:  \n- Expansion into new markets and product lines through strategic acquisitions.\n- Focus on international sales, which saw higher growth rates, supported by recent acquisitions.\n\nIn summary, AME\u2019s revenue growth in the past fiscal year and LTM period was mainly acquisition-driven, with additional support from currency effects and international market expansion, while organic growth was limited by inventory adjustments in key customer segments.\n\n(Sources: 2024 10-K report, 2024 Q2 and Q3 10-Q reports)"
