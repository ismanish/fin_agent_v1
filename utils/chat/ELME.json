The Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section attributes this increase primarily to the acquisition completed in 2023, which expanded the company\u2019s portfolio and contributed to higher rental income. Additionally, higher Net Operating Income (NOI) and lower general and administrative expenses supported improved operating results.\n\nFor the latest twelve-month (LTM) period, quarterly reports for 2024 show continued revenue growth, with incremental increases each quarter. The main drivers remain portfolio expansion from acquisitions and improved property performance, as indicated by higher NOI.\n\nIn summary, the key drivers behind revenue growth in the past fiscal year and LTM period have been:\n- Portfolio expansion through acquisitions completed in 2023.\n- Improved property performance leading to higher rental income.\n- Lower general and administrative expenses, which supported overall operating results.\n\nThese factors are directly referenced in the 2024 10-K and quarterly filings."
